      <p><strong>The Rules Have Changed</strong> is a trivia game about making things difficult for other people. It can accept any number of players. But it's probably best with 3-10.</p>
      <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
      <p>Each round will have one <strong>SysAdmin</strong>, and everyone else is an <strong>employee</strong>. The only thing the employees want to do is successfully create a password. If they can successfully create a password, they've succeeded in the round. It's the goal of the SysAdmin to make that as difficult as possible.</p>
      <p>Each round, the SysAdmin will choose a <strong>category</strong> of acceptable passwords (for example: "Types of Cheese"). This will generate a list of acceptable passwords that can be used. The SysAdmin can <em>then</em> cut down that list by <strong>adding rules</strong> (for example "You can't use the letter R" or "Your password must be more than 6 letters"). Each rule will cost some amount of ƒ, which the SysAdmin can spend as they like.</p>
      <p>Once rules are set, the SysAdmin can then <strong>create bugs</strong> in the system. (For example: "PARMESAN"). If any player types in one of the bugs the SysAdmin set, the server crashes and the round is over. The first bug is free, each additional bug costs 1 ƒ.</p>
      <p>There are time limits for both the SysAdmin and the employees.</p>
      <p>When the round concludes, a new SysAdmin is named.</p>
      <h2 id="final-round">Final Round</h2>
      <p>In the final round, all players try to crack any other player's password. All passwords entered in any round are fair game. If a player cracks another employee's password, they steal points from that player. Passwords can only be cracked once.</p>
      <p>If a player accidentally cracks their own password, they are punished.</p>
