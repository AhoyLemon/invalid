        strong The Rules Have Changed
        |  is a trivia game about making things difficult for other people. It can accept any number of players. But it's probably best with 4-10.

      p
        | Each round will have one 
        strong SysAdmin
        | , and everyone else is an 
        strong employee
        | . The only thing the employees want to do is successfully create a password. If they can successfully create a password, they've succeeded in the round. It's the goal of the SysAdmin to make that as difficult as possible.
      p
        | Each round, the SysAdmin will choose a 
        strong category
        |  of acceptable passwords (for example: "Types of Cheese"). This will generate a list of acceptable passwords that can be used. The SysAdmin can 
        em then
        |  cut down that list by 
        strong adding rules
        |  (for example "You can't use the letter R" or "Your password must be more than 6 letters"). Each rule will cost some amount of ƒ, which the SysAdmin can spend as they like.
      p
        | Once rules are set, the SysAdmin can then 
        strong create bugs
        |  in the system. (For example: "PARMESAN"). If any player types in one of the bugs the SysAdmin set, the server crashes and the round is over. The first bug is free, each additional bug costs 1 ƒ.
      p There are time limits for both the SysAdmin and the employees.
      p When the round concludes, a new SysAdmin is named.
      h2#final-round Final Round
      p In the final round, all players try to crack any other player's password. All passwords entered in any round are fair game. If a player cracks another employee's password, they steal points from that player. Passwords can only be cracked once.
      p If a player accidentally cracks their own password, they are punished.
