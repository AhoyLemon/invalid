## The Game

(Let's get this defined right away)

## Here's what I wanna add

Here, list everything you'd like to add. If you have multiple additions, please put them all in a single issue ticket.

If this is a challenge for **Invalid**, your list of possible answers *must* be sourced from some definitive source (usually Wikipedia, but any authority will do).

For **Wrongest Words**, make sure to put the hidden text in curly brackets, like this...
I don't know how to {click buttons} on Thursdays.
Also, include whatever category these lies belong in.

For **Comparatively Famous**, your suggested celebrities must have an active profile and some listed dollar value attached. Include a link to all celeb profiles.
