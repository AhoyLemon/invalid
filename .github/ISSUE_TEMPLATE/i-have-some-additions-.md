#### Which Game Is This For?
Let's get that defined at the start.

#### Okay, what would you like to add?
If this is a challenge for **Invalid**, your list of possible answers *must* be sourced from some definitive source (usually Wikipedia, but any authority will do).

For **Wrongest Words**, make sure to put the hidden text in curly brackets, like this...
`I don't know how to {click buttons} on Thursdays.`
Also, include whatever category these lies belong in.

For **Comparatively Famous**, your suggested celebrities must have a an active profile and some listed dollar value attached.
